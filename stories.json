      "title": "The Best Friends",
      "text": "<p>Once upon a time, there were two best friends named Hasan and Bilal. They did everything together: shared snacks, finished each other's sentences, and, most importantly, loved playing soccer! One sunny afternoon, while they were playing a fast and exciting game on the school field, they had a big disagreement.</p><p>'That was a foul!' shouted Bilal, pointing at Hasan. 'No, it wasn't! You just missed the ball!' Hasan yelled back.</p><p>Their voices got louder, and the silly argument grew bigger and bigger until both boys were so upset they decided they wouldn't speak to each other anymore. They turned their backs and walked in opposite directions.</p><p>One day passed, then two, then three. The silence was loud. Neither boy wanted to be the first to say sorry, even though their hearts felt tight and unhappy. Their friends on the playground noticed. 'Where are Hasan and Bilal?' they whispered. Everyone felt sad because the two were always together, laughing and working as a team. The soccer game just wasn't the same without their combined energy.</p><p>On the fourth morning, Bilal sat quietly at his desk. He felt a heavy, uneasy weight in his tummy, a feeling much worse than losing a game. He remembered a special lesson their wise teacher, Mr. Ahmed, had taught them weeks ago. Mr. Ahmed had spoken about the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) beautiful advice: 'Do not stop speaking to your brother for more than three days. The one who is first to say 'Salām' (peace be upon you) is the one whose mistake is forgiven.'</p><p>Bilal thought long and hard about those words. He missed Hasan's jokes and their secret high-fives. He realized that holding onto the anger was hurting him the most. His heart felt heavy, and he knew it was time to let go of the grudge. True strength, he decided, was not in stubbornness, but in kindness.</p><p>After school, Bilal saw Hasan standing alone by the main gate, looking down at his shoes. Taking a deep breath, Bilal gathered all his courage. He walked straight up to his friend and, with a soft but clear voice, he said:</p><p>'As-salamu alaykum.' (Peace be upon you.)</p><p>Hasan looked up, and his eyes suddenly brightened, shining like two stars. A huge smile spread across his face, and it was clear he had been hoping for this moment.</p><p>'Wa alaykum as-salam,' (And peace be upon you, too) he replied, his voice warm and relieved.</p><p>Both boys instantly felt the heaviness in their hearts vanish, like a dark storm cloud moving away to let the sunshine through. They smiled bigger, and then, without needing any more words, they rushed forward and gave each other a big, friendly hug. They both knew how much they had missed their friendship.</p><p>The very next day, they were back on the soccer field, passing the ball and laughing louder than ever.</p><p>Mr. Ahmed, their teacher, watched them play during recess. He walked over to them and said, 'MashaAllah (God has willed it), you two have learned a beautiful lesson. Our faith teaches us that anger and grudges are like chains that only hurt us. Forgiving each other and greeting with 'Salām' brings instant peace and joy, and it's the best way to be a good friend.'</p><p>From that day forward, Hasan and Bilal promised never to let a small argument, like a lost soccer ball, ruin their wonderful friendship again. They understood that taking the first step toward reconciliation is a sign of great strength and a path to a peaceful heart.</p>",

      "title": "The Three Days Rule",
      "text": "<p>Amir woke up on Friday morning with a heavy sigh. He felt a deep, uncomfortable sadness. He remembered exactly what happened four days ago: a big, silly fight with his best friend, Hassan, at school over a soccer ball that got lost in the bushes. Both boys had said mean things they didn't really mean, words that felt like sharp, tiny stones. Since then, they hadn't spoken a single word to each other.</p><p>Amir had tried to act strong, pretending he was fine ignoring Hassan, but it wasn't true. His chest felt tight, like he was carrying a heavy backpack all the time. He missed their lunchtime jokes and their after-school adventures.</p><p>He went downstairs to the kitchen, where his father was sitting, quietly reading a book. \"Good morning, Dad,\" Amir said softly. \"And a good morning to you, my son,\" his father replied, smiling warmly. \"Come, sit with me.\" Amir sat down, staying silent for a moment. His father, seeing the worry lines on his son's face, gently asked, \"What is troubling you, Amir? You seem to be carrying a cloud today.\"</p><p>Amir took a big breath and let it out slowly. \"I had a big fight with Hassan, and we haven't been friends for four days now.\" His father closed his book and gave Amir his full attention. \"My son, do you know what our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us? He said that it is not right for a person to stop speaking to his friend for more than three days. Do you know why that is a special rule?\" Amir shook his head.</p><p>\"It is because if hearts stay far apart for too long,\" his father explained, \"they get sick, like a plant without water. But when you make peace, the good feelings come back and your spirit shines brightly again. Holding onto anger is like holding a hot coal—you only burn yourself.\" Amir lowered his gaze, feeling a little embarrassed. \"But Dad... I was very angry, too. And I still think I was right about the ball,\" he mumbled.</p><p>His father chuckled gently and put a loving hand on his shoulder. \"Feeling angry is a natural feeling, my son. Everyone gets angry sometimes. But the mistake is letting the anger stay in control. Our faith teaches us the most important kind of courage: the courage to say, 'I am sorry.' That little phrase is like a bucket of water that puts out the fire of an argument, and it makes your heart feel instantly lighter.\"</p><p>A wave of relief washed over Amir. \"You're right, Dad. After the Friday prayer, I am going to find Hassan and tell him sorry.\" After the prayer finished at the mosque, Amir walked out slowly, looking around. He spotted Hassan standing with his own father. Amir's heart was thumping, but he remembered his father's words about courage. He walked up to his friend and said in a quiet but clear voice, \"Hi Hassan... can we talk for a minute?\"</p><p>Hassan looked surprised, but he nodded. They walked a short distance away from their fathers. Amir didn't hesitate. \"Hassan, I am truly sorry. I should not have yelled at you, and I shouldn't have said those mean things. It doesn't matter who lost the ball. I really miss being your friend.\" A huge, bright smile appeared on Hassan's face. \"I'm sorry too, Amir! I was wrong for what I said back to you. I felt awful all week.\"</p><p>The two boys laughed, shook hands, and felt peace returning to their hearts. When they returned to their fathers, Hassan's dad smiled at them. \"Well done, boys! That is what true friendship is all about.\" On the walk home, Amir thought to himself: \"Wow... just three days, and my heart already felt heavy. I’ll never wait that long again.\" Amir had learned a powerful lesson that day: making peace is the bravest thing you can do, and kindness is what truly makes your heart shine.</p>",

      "title": "The Tiny Seed of Arrogance",
      "text": "<p>Amir loved studying, and one day he came first in his class exam. His parents were proud, and his teacher praised him in front of everyone. Amir felt so happy that he began looking down on his classmates. When Hasan struggled to answer a question, Amir smirked and whispered to Amirah, 'He'll never be as smart as me.' Amirah frowned. 'Amir, that's not nice.' But Amir brushed it off, feeling superior. Over the next week, Amir started to act arrogantly, always showing off his high marks and refusing to help others.</p><p>One afternoon, Teacher Fatima noticed his attitude. She called him aside and asked gently, 'Amir, do you know what the Prophet ﷺ said? He said: He who has in his heart an ant's weight of arrogance will not enter Paradise.' Amir's eyes widened. 'Not even a tiny bit?' She nodded. 'Yes, arrogance makes us forget that all success comes from Allah, not from ourselves.'</p><p>That evening, Amir thought deeply. He remembered how Hasan had once shared his lunch with him when he forgot his own, and how Amirah always helped him revise. He realized he had no reason to think he was better than others. Feeling ashamed, he prayed, 'O Allah, forgive me. Everything I have is from You.'</p><p>The next day, he went to Hasan and said, 'I'm sorry for being rude. Will you let me help you with your homework?' Hasan smiled, 'Of course, my friend.' Amir learned that true honor comes from humility, not arrogance. From then on, he tried to be humble and grateful, knowing that arrogance only closes the doors to Paradise.</p>",

      "title": "The Helping Hand",
      "text": "<p>Amirah was walking home from school when she saw an elderly woman struggling to carry heavy grocery bags. The woman stopped often, resting on a bench, her face showing exhaustion. Amirah hesitated for a moment, then remembered what her father always told her: 'Whoever helps ease one in difficulty, Allah will make it easy for him in this world and the Hereafter.' Amirah ran to the woman and said politely, 'Assalamu alaykum, Auntie. Can I help you carry your bags?' The woman smiled with relief, 'Wa alaykum salam, dear child. JazakAllahu khayran, yes please.'</p><p>Amirah carried the bags alongside her. They talked about school, the woman's grandchildren, and how kindness makes the world brighter. When they reached her home, the woman made du'a for Amirah: 'May Allah bless you and ease all your difficulties.' Amirah felt her heart glow. That evening, when her father heard what she had done, he smiled proudly. 'MashaAllah, my daughter. Remember, whenever you help someone in difficulty, Allah helps you even more.'</p><p>Amirah realized that the small act of carrying groceries was actually very big in Allah's eyes. She understood that kindness is not measured by size, but by intention and sincerity. From that day, she looked for opportunities to ease others' burdens — helping her mother in the kitchen, carrying her sister's books, and even comforting a sad classmate. Each time, she whispered, 'O Allah, ease my path as I ease theirs.'</p>",

      "text": "<p>One sunny afternoon, Amir and Amirah were playing outside with their little sister, Layla. Layla was still learning how to kick a ball, but Amir grew impatient when she kept missing. 'You're too small to play with us!' he shouted. Layla's eyes filled with tears. Amirah quickly went to her and hugged her. 'Don't cry, Layla. You're doing great.' Amir frowned, but Amirah reminded him gently, 'The Prophet ﷺ said: He is not one of us who does not show mercy to our young.'</p><p>Amir's face softened. He realized he had hurt his sister's feelings. He picked up the ball and handed it to Layla. 'I'm sorry. Come, I'll show you how to kick it properly.' With patience, Amir guided her step by step. Layla laughed when she finally managed to kick the ball a little distance. 'I did it!' she shouted joyfully. Their mother, watching from the window, smiled and said, 'MashaAllah, that's how an older brother should be — kind and merciful.'</p><p>From then on, Amir learned to be gentler with his younger sister. He realized that showing mercy was not weakness but strength. Layla looked up to him even more, and their bond grew stronger. Amir understood that the Prophet ﷺ's guidance was not just words, but a way to fill homes and hearts with love and mercy.</p>",

Some boys laughed at how long he was taking. Hasan felt uncomfortable. He hurried over and said, 'Assalamu alaykum, Uncle. Let me help you.' He carefully placed the man's shoes on the rack and guided him inside. The man smiled, 'Wa alaykum salam, my son. JazakAllahu khayran.' Later, Hasan's father praised him, 'The Prophet ﷺ said: He is not one of us who does not respect our elders.'</p><p>After salah, the imam gave a short reminder. He explained how respecting elders is part of faith — offering them seats, speaking gently, listening to their advice, and never mocking their weakness. Hasan felt proud that he had acted rightly. On the way home, he promised himself that he would always be gentle with older people, remembering that one day, he too would grow old. Respecting elders, he realized, is not just kindness, but a way to honor Allah's blessings in those who came before us.</p>",

When Teacher Fatima checked, Amirah's plant had grown green leaves, while Amir's had withered. 'Every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock,' the teacher reminded them. 'This plant was your flock.' Amir felt ashamed.

Layla was still learning how to kick a ball, but Amir grew impatient when she kept missing. 'You're too small to play with us!' he shouted. Layla's eyes filled with tears. Amirah quickly went to her and hugged her. 'Don't cry, Layla. You're doing great.' Amir frowned, but Amirah reminded him gently, 'The Prophet ﷺ said: He is not one of us who does not show mercy to our young.'</p><p>Amir's face softened. He realized he had hurt his sister's feelings. He picked up the ball and handed it to Layla. 'I'm sorry. Come, I'll show you how to kick it properly.' With patience, Amir guided her step by step. Layla laughed when she finally managed to kick the ball a little distance. 'I did it!' she shouted joyfully. Their mother, watching from the window, smiled and said, 'MashaAllah, that's how an older brother should be — kind and merciful.'</p><p>From then on, Amir learned to be gentler with his younger sister. He realized that showing mercy was not weakness but strength. Layla looked up to him even more, and their bond grew stronger. Amir understood that the Prophet ﷺ's guidance was not just words, but a way to fill homes and hearts with love and mercy.</p>",

      "text": "<p>Hasan loved visiting the masjid with his father. One day, he saw an elderly man slowly walking with a cane. The man struggled to remove his shoes at the entrance. Some boys laughed at how long he was taking. Hasan felt uncomfortable. He hurried over and said, 'Assalamu alaykum, Uncle. Let me help you.' He carefully placed the man's shoes on the rack and guided him inside. The man smiled, 'Wa alaykum salam, my son. JazakAllahu khayran.' Later, Hasan's father praised him, 'The Prophet ﷺ said: He is not one of us who does not respect our elders.'</p><p>After salah, the imam gave a short reminder. He explained how respecting elders is part of faith — offering them seats, speaking gently, listening to their advice, and never mocking their weakness. Hasan felt proud that he had acted rightly. On the way home, he promised himself that he would always be gentle with older people, remembering that one day, he too would grow old. Respecting elders, he realized, is not just kindness, but a way to honor Allah's blessings in those who came before us.</p>",

      "text": "<p>At school, Teacher Fatima gave the class an important task: each student had to take care of a small plant for two weeks. Amirah received a tiny pot with a sprouting seed. She watered it daily, made sure it had sunlight, and even spoke to it gently. Amir, however, forgot about his plant. When Teacher Fatima checked, Amirah's plant had grown green leaves, while Amir's had withered. 'Every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock,' the teacher reminded them. 'This plant was your flock.' Amir felt ashamed. He realized responsibility means caring for what is entrusted to us — family, friends, belongings, or even pets.</p><p>That evening, he told his parents what happened. His father said, 'We are all shepherds in different ways. I am responsible for this family, and you are responsible for your actions.' Amir promised to do better. He started helping around the house, feeding the cat, and being more mindful in salah. Slowly, he learned that responsibility is not a burden but an honor. Being a shepherd means protecting, guiding, and caring — just as the Prophet ﷺ taught.</p>",

Bilal felt uneasy. Later, he remembered the hadith: 'Follow up a bad deed with a good deed; it wipes it out.' Bilal realized he had done wrong. The next day, he brought a new pencil and gave it to his friend. 'I'm sorry about yesterday,' he said. His friend's face brightened, 'Thank you, Bilal!' The anger between them disappeared.</p><p>That evening, Bilal told his mother what he had done. She smiled, 'MashaAllah. Everyone makes mistakes, but the best people are those who fix them with good deeds.' Bilal learned that sins and mistakes can be wiped away not just by saying sorry, but also by doing good afterwards. From that day, whenever he made a mistake, he quickly tried to replace it with kindness. He understood that no one is perfect, but Islam gives us a way to turn errors into blessings by following up with good deeds.</p>",
